# GeoTracker Instructions

Before using the GeoTracker app, please follow these steps to ensure a smooth experience:

## 1. Prepare the SD Card

Make sure you have an SD card inserted into your device. The app requires an SD card to download map tile data. If your device doesn't have an SD card slot, you may need to insert one or use an external storage option.

## 2. Set Date and Time Automatically

To accurately use map-related features and ensure proper synchronization, set the date and time on your device to update automatically. Here's how to do it:

- **For Android:**
    - Go to your device's "Settings."
    - Scroll down and select "System" or "General Management."
    - Tap on "Date & time" or "Time & Date."
    - Toggle on "Set time automatically" and "Set time zone automatically" if available.
    - Your device will now automatically synchronize the date and time with network-provided information.

These instructions will help you get the most out of the GeoTracker app by ensuring that map tile data can be downloaded and that your device's date and time are accurately set for location-based features.
